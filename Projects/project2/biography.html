            DJ Terrible is based off the cold lands of Canada where they is
            constantly inspired by the sounds of construction and destruction.
            Their hometown in Montreal, Quebec is where they started their
            career as a recorder player in elementary school. They were terrible
            at it. Their professors discouraged them of any career in music
            because all the other students and faculty complained of the
            horrible bird noises when in fact it was DJ Terrible attempting to
            play their first instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long after, they auditioned in their high school band and they
            failed miserably. The judges were not impressed of his rendition of
            Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" on the recorder. Disappointed,
            they left the audition with a hope to find a community accepting of
            their artistic vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            At age 21, DJ Terrible stumbled across Youtube for the first time
            and they came across the official video of "Axel F" from Crazy Frog.
            The upbeat, auto-tuned and crazy looking frog was his main
            inspiration to start music production. Today, they continue to
            practice making new tunes (which you can on this website!) and
            practice the recorder on a daily basis in hopes to find their first
            venue to perform live. Please consider hiring DJ Terrible at your
            next bar mitzvah, wedding anniversary party or workplace corporate
            gathering. DJ Terrible's goal is to bring the Terrible to the table!
