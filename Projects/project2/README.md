ARTIST STATEMENT

DJ Terrible Portfolio
By Atima Ng

ARTISTIC VISION

DJ Terrible's portfolio showcases the terrible tunes produced by the fictional DJ Terrible throughout their short career as a DJ Producer. The goal was to create a website using elements from JQuery, Jquery UI and Responsive voice to design an interactive website to present their tunes produced and their colorful aesthetic with the website. Aesthetically, the goal was to use bright colors inspired by the 1990's to match their eclectic music style. Serif and large type was used as graphical elements on the page. On the "DANCE PARTY" page, the gif used were inspired by the 90's video game style, where the art style was mainly pixel-based. Animals were chosen because it was a random decision, just like DJ Terrible's music.

Please note the music was chosen to be as random and kitsch as possible. In no way do I find cheap electronic and 1st grader recordings pleasurable. The goal was so look good, but to sound terrible.

DESIRED USER EXPERIENCE

The user experience is meant to be easy to use and accessible. Most DJ portfolios are found on Soundcloud, and that merely showcases the artistic vision of musicians, especially when they are as talented as the wonderful DJ Terrible. BY incorporating draggable, sortable elements makes it easy for the user to understand what to do.

HOW I ACCOMPLISHED TECHNICALLY AND ARTISTICALLY

DJ Terrible is inspired by bright, flashy moving pieces that interact with his tunes. To present their music in the most efficient way, it was important to visually represent a bright and loud aesthetic while presenting cheaply produced music found on freesounds.com. The visual language is not supposed to match the "meat" of the website.

Technically, elements from the music world were incorporated to simulate the world of a DJ. On the "TUNES" page, the guests are draggable on a bright dance floor while on the "DANCE" page, users can control the volume of the music playing with a slider while controlling the DJ Dancefloor colors. Most importantly, it was important to showcase the variety of songs DJ Terrible produced in their life. In the "biography" page, users can rate their songs with a sortable element on the page.

Voila. Enjoy the terrible from DJ Terrible. You will not get enough of it.
