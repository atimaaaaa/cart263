DJ Terrible Portfolio

By Atima Ng

DJ Terrible's portfolio showcases the terrible tunes produced by the fictional DJ Terrible throughout their short career as a DJ Producer. The goal was to create a website using elements from JQuery and Jquery UI to design an interactive website to present their tunes produced and their colorful aesthetic with the website.

DJ Terrible is inspired by bright, colorful moving pieces that interact with his tunes.
